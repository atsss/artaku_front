    'Art is an exploration of truth that is not limited to human activities, but also encompasses the entire universe.',
    'It is a cross-disciplinary practice of science and philosophy that is expressed through various media.',
    'In order to capture the essence of the universe, I apply a quantum mechanical way of thinking in an attempt to exist on the edge of chaos and order. In order to grasp the essence of humanity, I consciously design creative processes that capture unconscious thoughts to clarify functionalities of the human mind.',
    'Thoughts, assumptions, and insights are expressed in different manners, extracting possibilities from nothing and embodying them to make intangible things tangible. In the process of artistic and conceptual visualization, the combination and reflection of light is a key element that allows humans to observe: art can exist.',
    'My body and mind are catalysts to synthesize both nothing and everything in an effort to evoke emptiness and create a mirror that reflects the ways in which humanity lives in such a space.',
    'My work is influenced by my experience growing up with synesthesia (the visualization of music and sound), as well as the Japanese sense of beauty, in which a primary focus on space creates harmony between chaos and order.'
